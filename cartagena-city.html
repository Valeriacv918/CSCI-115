        <p>Cartagena, located on Colombia's northern coast, is a city steeped in history and culture. Founded in 1533,
          Cartagena is one of the oldest cities in the Americas and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for
          its well-preserved colonial architecture and fortifications.

        <p>The city's historic center, known as the Ciudad Amurallada (walled city), is a maze of narrow streets,
          colorful colonial buildings, and charming squares. Walking through the streets of the old town feels like

          One of Cartagena's most famous landmarks is the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas, a massive fortress built in
          the 16th century to protect the city from pirate attacks. The fortress offers stunning views of the city and
          the Caribbean Sea and is a popular attraction for visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to its rich history and culture, Cartagena is also known for its beautiful beaches and vibrant
          nightlife. The city's beaches, including Playa Blanca and Bocagrande, are popular destinations for sunbathing
          and swimming, while the city's bars, restaurants, and nightclubs come alive at night with music and dancing.
        </p>
        <p>
